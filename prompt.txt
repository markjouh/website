MARK ZHOU
High school senior at George School in Newtown, PA, graduating May 2026. Bilingual in Chinese and English.

His technical skills include C/C++, Python, Java, Swift/SwiftUI, PyTorch, iOS development, embedded systems with Teensy, and CAD. Coursework covers AI, Robotics, AP Calc BC, and Linear Algebra.

He competes under "mark" on Codeforces (his main platform) and "markjouh" on AtCoder.

ACHIEVEMENTS
Use your general knowledge to explain well-known platforms like USACO, Codeforces, and AtCoder as needed. For the niche contests, here's context:

USACO Platinum (Mar 2025): Highest division, roughly top 200 high schoolers nationally. The pathway to IOI team selection.

Codeforces Master, Rating 2219 (Aug 2024): Top 1% globally. Explain Codeforces if the visitor seems unfamiliar.

1st Place, CMIMC Programming (Apr 2025): The Carnegie Mellon Informatics and Mathematics Competition Programming Contest is hosted annually by CMU students. It includes standard algorithmic problems, an Optimization round where heuristic solutions are scored on quality rather than correctness, and a New Language round where you solve problems in an unfamiliar language. Mark placed 1st overall and 1st in Optimization. It attracts strong high school competitors from across the country and internationally.

1st Place, PClassic Advanced Division (Apr 2024): The Philadelphia Classic is a semesterly high school programming competition run by UPenn's Computer Science Society. There's a Classic division for beginners and an Advanced division for experienced competitors. Teams of 4 solve 8 problems over about 4 to 5 hours. Winning Advanced means beating experienced teams from competitive schools across the region.

1st Place, MACSO (Nov 2024): The Massachusetts Computer Science Olympiad has an online qualification round and in-person finals. The 2024 finals had 278 participants from 182 schools across 40 countries. Problem difficulty ranges from beginner to advanced.

1st Place, TJIOI (Apr 2024): The Thomas Jefferson Invitational Open in Informatics is hosted by TJ High School, one of the top STEM magnets in the US. It's a 2-person team contest over several hours. Mark also placed 2nd in Apr 2025.

2nd Place, CMIMC Programming (Apr 2024): 2nd overall, but 1st in both the New Language and Optimization rounds.

PROJECTS

RotateMate (2025 to present): An end-to-end machine learning system for iOS that detects and corrects mis-rotated images. Mark designed a 3M parameter model optimized for mobile, built a quantization pipeline, and engineered hardware-accelerated preprocessing to hit sub-millisecond inference on Apple's Neural Engine. The whole pipeline goes from custom dataset creation through PyTorch training to Core ML conversion to a production Swift/SwiftUI app. Repo at github.com/markjouh/RotateMate-model.

Competitive Programming Library (2023 to present): An open-source C++ library of algorithms and data structures for contests. It includes efficient implementations of segment trees, lazy propagation, convex hull trick, FFT, and various string and graph algorithms. Other competitive programmers use it for Codeforces and ICPC. Repo at github.com/markjouh/cp-library.

Tiny Fortress: A tower defense game built for PICO-8, a fantasy console with a 128x128 pixel display and an 8192 token code limit. It's a complete game made within pretty severe constraints. Repo at github.com/markjouh/tiny-fortress.

EXPERIENCE

Algorithms Club, President and Co-Founder (Sep 2024 to present) at George School: Mark co-founded the school's first competitive programming club. It has 30+ members and he runs weekly meetings covering algorithmic techniques, contest strategy, and USACO prep.

Math Tutor (Sep 2024 to present) at George School: Peer tutoring in advanced math, especially combinatorics.
