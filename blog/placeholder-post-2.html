        <h1>Why I Started Collecting Air From Different Elevators</h1>

        April 2025
        
        <p><em>This is a placeholder blog post.</em></p>
    
    <p>It started innocently enough. One day, while ascending to the 47th floor of a downtown high-rise, I noticed it: each elevator has its own distinct atmospheric signature. Now, three years and 2,847 mason jars later, I'm proud to say I have one of the world's most comprehensive elevator air collections.</p>
    
        <p><strong>The Science Behind Elevator Air</strong></p>
    
    <p>Every elevator shaft creates a unique microclimate. The combination of cable lubricant off-gassing, the collective anxiety of thousands of awkward small-talk attempts, and the residual essence of hastily consumed breakfast burritos creates what I call an "elevmosphere." No two are alike. It's like wine terroir, but vertical and significantly more claustrophobic.</p>
    
        <p><strong>My Collection Methodology</strong></p>
    
    <p>I've developed a rigorous sampling protocol. First, I enter the elevator alone (witnesses tend to call security). Then, at precisely the midpoint of the journey, I uncap my sterile mason jar and perform three counter-clockwise swirls to capture the air at its peak ripeness. Each jar is labeled with building name, floor range, time of day, and number of times someone pressed the already-lit button.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Notable Specimens in My Collection</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Jar #0001:</strong> Google HQ, Mountain View - Hints of kombucha and imposter syndrome</li>
        <li><strong>Jar #0234:</strong> Empire State Building - Tourist sweat with undertones of crushed dreams</li>
        <li><strong>Jar #0567:</strong> Hospital Freight Elevator - Medical-grade disinfectant and existential dread</li>
        <li><strong>Jar #1123:</strong> Luxury Condo, Manhattan - Eau de privilege with notes of tax evasion</li>
        <li><strong>Jar #1789:</strong> Mall Service Elevator - Cinnamon pretzel and retail despair</li>
        <li><strong>Jar #2001:</strong> Space Needle - Vertigo and overpriced souvenir essence</li>
        <li><strong>Jar #2455:</strong> DMV Building - Bureaucracy and broken dreams, aged 6-8 hours in line</li>
    </ul>
    
        <p><strong>The Aging Process</strong></p>
    
    <p>Like fine wine, elevator air improves with age. I store my jars in a climate-controlled basement at exactly 67°F and 42% humidity. Every six months, I rotate them one-quarter turn clockwise to ensure even distribution of particulates. My 2019 vintage from the Willis Tower is particularly exceptional - you can really taste the architectural hubris.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Tasting Notes From Recent Acquisitions</strong></p>
    
    <p>Last week's Goldman Sachs elevator had an aggressive nose with hints of cocaine residue and moral bankruptcy. The finish was surprisingly smooth, with a lingering aftertaste of insider trading. In contrast, the public library elevator offered a more subtle bouquet of dusty knowledge and homeless person's dignity. Truly a people's air.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p>
    
    <p>I'm currently working on a coffee table book: "Vertical Vintages: An Olfactory Journey Through America's Elevators." I'm also in talks with the Smithsonian about a permanent exhibition, though they keep insisting I need "actual scientific merit" and to "stop calling them at 3 AM."</p>
    
    <p>My ultimate goal? To capture air from the International Space Station's elevator. Yes, I know it doesn't have one. That's what makes it the ultimate challenge.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Join the Movement</strong></p>
    
    <p>If you're interested in starting your own elevator air collection, remember: it's not about the destination, it's about the journey. And also about looking completely insane to everyone sharing that journey with you. But mostly it's about preserving these fleeting vertical moments for future generations who may never know the joy of being trapped between floors with eight strangers and someone's leftover fish lunch.</p>
