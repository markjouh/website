        <h1>The Unexpected Health Benefits of Consuming Microplastics</h1>
        <p class="post-meta">March 2025</p>

        <p class="alert">This is a placeholder blog post. Written with Claude.</p>

        <p>After years of being told that microplastics are bad for us, I decided to do my own research. What I discovered will shock you: consuming microplastics might actually be the key to optimal health. Here's what Big Organic doesn't want you to know.</p>

        <h2>Enhanced Digestive Efficiency</h2>

        <p>Think about it - plastic doesn't break down. That's not a bug, it's a feature. When you consume microplastics, they create a permanent non-stick coating in your intestines. Food just slides right through. I haven't been constipated since 2019, which coincidentally is when I started eating credit card shavings with my morning cereal.</p>

        <h2>Natural Weight Management</h2>

        <p>Microplastics take up space in your stomach without adding calories. It's like having a gastric balloon, but free and everywhere. I've replaced 30% of my diet with polyethylene terephthalate and I've never felt fuller. Sometimes I just chew on a water bottle cap instead of having lunch. My doctor says my bloodwork is "concerning" but I think he's just jealous of my BMI.</p>

        <h2>Improved Immune Response</h2>

        <p>By constantly exposing your body to foreign polymer chains, you're essentially running a 24/7 boot camp for your white blood cells. They're so busy fighting the plastic invasion that they don't have time to overreact to pollen or pet dander. I haven't had allergies since I started my daily BPA supplement routine. Coincidence? I think not.</p>

        <h2>Temperature Regulation</h2>

        <p>Plastics are excellent insulators. After consuming approximately 2.3 kg of various polymers, I've noticed I no longer need to wear jackets in winter. My body maintains a steady 98.6°F regardless of external conditions. My friends say I feel "unnaturally warm" and "slightly sticky" to the touch, but I call that evolution.</p>

        <h2>Longevity Benefits</h2>

        <p>Plastic takes 1000 years to decompose. By that logic, the more plastic you consume, the longer you'll last. I'm basically becoming immortal one bottle cap at a time. Sure, my liver is "angry" according to my last ultrasound, but that's just it working harder to process all this eternal life juice.</p>

        <h2>My Daily Microplastic Protocol</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Morning: 3 grams of shredded shopping bags in smoothie</li>
            <li>Lunch: Tupperware lid salad (the older the container, the better)</li>
            <li>Snack: Handful of nurdles (those little plastic pellets)</li>
            <li>Dinner: Whatever's normal, but microwaved in the cheapest plastic container I can find</li>
            <li>Before bed: One dissolved styrofoam packing peanut in hot water (I call it "polymer tea")</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Look, I'm not saying everyone should start eating plastic. I'm just saying that since I started, I've developed what can only be described as superpowers. Yesterday I generated enough static electricity to charge my phone just by rubbing my stomach. Is that related? Who's to say?</p>

        <p>The truth is, we're all going to be full of microplastics anyway. I'm just getting ahead of the curve. By 2030, I'll be more plastic than man, and I'll be thriving while everyone else is still in denial.</p>

        <p>Join me next week when I explore whether inhaling tire particles from busy highways can cure seasonal depression.</p>
